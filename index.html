        <h1>Arizona vs. Gant (2009)</h1>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          In early 2008 Arizona officers responded to a call regarding a house
          to have some seemingly suspicious activity. When the officers arrived
          Rodney Gant answered and responded saying the owner would be home
          later that day. When the officers ran Gant’s license they saw that
          Gant had been driving with a suspended license and had an outstanding
          warrant for his arrest. The officers then put Gant under arrest and
          placed him in the squad care. After, they search Gant's car finding a
          handgun and cocaine. During his trial the defendant asked the Arizona
          Supreme court if they could suppress the evidence found in his car on
          the account of the fourth amendment. He believed that the officers had
          unreasonable cause to search his vehicle. <br />
          Ultimately, the judge denied the request and he was charged on the
          account of cocaine possession. The Arizona Supreme court's main
          reasoning behind it’s decision was that Gant voluntarily left his
          vehicles, which would then allow the officers to search his car.
        </p>

        <h2>Ruling</h2>
        <p>
          The Supreme court decided the officer’s search was unwarranted and in
          violation of the fourth amendment. Their reasoning was that the
          officers should not have searched his car unless they had a reason
          related to the arrest. Justice John Paul Stevensy, Justices Antonin G.
          Scalia, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg had
          majority rule stating, “warrantless searches are per se unreasonable”
          and also that this scenario did not fall under the small exception to
          this statement, The remaining four: Justice Samuel A. Alito Chief
          Justice John G. Roberts, Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Stephen G.
          Breyer were against this decision saying that the officers decisions
          weren’t in violation of the defendant’s rights. With a 5 to 4 vote in
          favor of the defendant Gant was only charged on the account of driving
          with a suspended license.

        <h2>Personal Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          This case is a good example of the limits and exceptions of the fourth
          amendment. The main question around this case is “Can an officer
          search an arrestee's car after they have already been put under arrest
          and in a squad car?” I think that the court case should have gone to
          the supreme court. This is definitely a case up for discussion and it
          should be talked amongst as many people as possible. Usually when a
          case goes to the use the US Supreme court it has been through all the
          steps before and the judges have heard all the opinions of everyone
          before so their decision is better formed. I think this could have
          been handled at a state level but with it concerning the constitution
          i feel it's better that the US Supreme Court made the final decision.I
          do agree with the majority vote, however I can see some of the
          perspective of the minority vote. I agree that they had no explicit
          warrant to search his car after they had already put him under arrest.
          On the other hand the officers had already put him into the squad car
          and, to some, it could be seen as them having probable cause to search
          the vehicle. I think the Constitution was written as vague so that it
          could be interpreted differently as needed as times change. This
          scenario is a grey area on whether this is a violation of the
          constitution, but it's the court's responsibility to properly
          interpret, and I believe they did it fairly and accurately. I think
          from now on when a similar case occurs then judges will look closer at
          the circumstances of the search and seizure. If was one of the judges
          I would have definitely voted to suppress the charges and evidence
          that wasn't directly involved with the original account of a suspended
          license and an outstanding warrant. At that point I feel that the
          officers were out to get Gant even if in reality they weren’t.
